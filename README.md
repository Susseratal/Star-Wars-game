Star Wars Fighting Game README

The other day while browsing reddit, I found an interesting looking post abot a Star Wars themed, text based fighting game. I liked the idea, and some bits of the execution, but thought that the code looked a bit messy, so asked if I could have a go at rewriting it. 

You can see the original code in the "Original.py" file. 
The original creator of the idea and original code is: https://www.reddit.com/user/Robobluey/

I don't really care about making this lore accurate to Star Wars, I just thought that the original code could use a bit of improving and thought that just because it's a basic python game doesn't mean that you can't at least try and tell a clever story with it.

If you liked what I did with this, go send the original creator some love, support and encouragement.

Thanks, 
Iain
