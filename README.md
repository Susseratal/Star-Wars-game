Star Wars Fighting Game README

The other day while browsing reddit, I found an interesting looking post abot a Star Wars themed, text based fighting game. I liked the idea, and some bits of the execution, but thought that the code looked a bit messy, so asked if I could have a go at rewriting it. 

You can see the original code in the "Original.py" file. 
The original creator of the idea and original code is: https://www.reddit.com/user/Robobluey/
You can see the original post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/comments/hx9l43/the_text_based_beta_of_a_star_wars_fan_gam_im/

Hope you like what I did with it, but also, go show Robobluey some love. 

Thanks, 
Iain
